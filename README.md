Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

This is comprised of the small projects I like to build for fun when I have spare time, mostly focussed towards robotics and learning new skills.

For an example project with a bit of a write-up, see my [carpet-based localisation system wiki](https://github.com/tim-fan/carpet_localisation/wiki/Carpet-Localisation)
